        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>My father and I created this easy 5-ingredient chili recipe 
            and everyone we have made it for loved it. 
            It is fast, simple, and delicious.</p>
            

        <h2>ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans, not drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and 
                stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned 
                and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce.
                 Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat
                  to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until 
                  thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt 
                  and pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
